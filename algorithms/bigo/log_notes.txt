logarithm is the opposite of exponential functions. 

consider a tree with level 3 height. 
    each level the number of children doubles. 
    so by height 3, total number of nodes is 8. 2^3 = 8 
    this is exponential growth. 

now when a BST is traversed, we cut search space by half.
so lg (n) is the time complexity because we discard half the nodes each time.
