applications: 
- searching - binary search on sorted records is O(n) 
- finding two closest points in a sorted array 
- element uniqueness - are there any duplicates? 
- frequency distribution 
- selection - what is the kth largest item in the array. 

ordering in sorting: 
- increasing or decreasing? 
- what to do with equal keys? 
- sort only keys or entire records? 
- how to sort non-numerical data? 

* a stable sort is where relative ordering of elements is preserved. 
* a comparison sort as opposed to stable sort does not guarantee that relative ordering is maintained, so if a <= b and b <= a, then either of these could come first in the sorted order. In a stable sort this is not the case and the order is maintained. 
* a comparison sort must have a running time of O(n lg n).
