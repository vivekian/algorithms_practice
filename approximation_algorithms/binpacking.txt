- Bin packing problem is stated as given n items with size Si, place them in as few bins as possible of unit capacity. 
- Variant of the problem is that the bins could have different sizes. 

- Possible solutions to the problem are: 
    * Next Fit algorithm 
    * First Fit algorithm 

- Next fit algorithm requires that we pick up item in any given order and start placing them in bins. 
- If an item does not fit in a bin, we close that bin (to never reopen it) and move on to the next bin. 
- The key insight here is that for a given pair of bins (1,2 or 3,4 or 5,6), their combined weight is 
  always greater than the unit capacity of a single bin. 
        (Items in bin 2i -1) + next item > UnitCapacity 
  This insight leads to the proof that: 
        (Total weight of the items) > (k-1)/2 * UnitCapacity 
  e.g. 2400 > (k-1)/2 * 100 
       k < 49 is the upper bound for next fit algorithm. 
- An optimum solution would k = (Total Weight)/UnitCapacity 
    e.g. 2400/100 = 24 bins. 
- How does Next Fit do with respect to OPT solution? 
      #(bins by Next Fit) < 2 * OPT + 1 
      e.g in the above example 
        48 < 49 

- First fit algorithm 
    - Sort the items in decreasing order. 
    - Insert each object one by one into the first bin which has room for it. 
    - If no bin has room, then start a new bin. 
    - This algorithm has a running time of O(nlgn) + bn 
            where b < min(m, n) 
    - Above explains itself based on sorting time and sweeping through all the bins for each item. 
    - There are more details in the Skiena book (pages 595)
