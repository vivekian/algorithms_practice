* are any 2 points connected? can you reach from point A to point B? 
* driving directions. - shortest path. 
* how to solve a sudoko puzzle? 
    - there is an initial state 
    - there is an end goal state
    - formulate a plan from a start to an end goal. 

* basics of graph search 
    - find everything findable from the start vertex. 
    - search should be efficient - don't repeat visits to indices. 
    - goal is O(m+n) where m is vertices and n is the number of edges. 
    - generic algo: 
        - create empty set s no nodes are visited. 
        - while possible: 
               explore edge and mark node as visited
