- BST data structure with extra information - color field. 

- Red Black properties: 
    * every node is either Red or Black. 
    * root and leaves are all Black. 
    * every Red node's parent is Black.
    * all simple paths from a node x to a descendent leaf of x has the same number 
      of Black nodes in them. Height(Black) - count does not include x itself. 
    
- The above properties should force the tree to have log(n) height. 

- The tricky part is to maintain these properties.  

- Height of a red-black tree: 
    red black trees with n keys has a height of h <= 2lg(n) or O(lgN)
