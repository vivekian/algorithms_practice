Reconsider a binary tree from preorder traversal data with leaf nodes marked as null. 

Given a preorder and inorder traversal data, reconstruct a binary tree.

Compute the exterior of a binary tree  

Find the successor of a key in a binary search tree: 

    - check if a right subtree exists for the key: 
        * if it does then get the minimum key of the subtree and return it. 
    - if it does not, then get the parent of the key: 
        * if the parent is non-null and the key is a right child, then update the child and parent by moving one layer up. 
        * if the parent is null or key is non-right child, then return the parent as the successor.
