- there are 2 ways to represent graphs. 
- adjacency matrix 
    * fast answer to if [x,y] are connected. 
    * takes up a lot of space on sparse matrices. n2 
- adjacency lists 
    * use linked lists to store the neighbors. 
    * easy to traverse through all neighbors. 
    * easy to find the degree of a vertex 
    * edge insertion/deletion O(d)

in most cases just stick to adjacency lists.
