use cases: 
- convert long url to short url 
- convert short url to long url and redirect 
- rmeove a given url or maybe not? 

implementation: 
    maintain a hashmap which maps a key to a value (short url to long url) 
    maintain a hashmap which maps the long url to a short url as well. 
    need a method to generate the unique url as well. 

scalability 
    - place multiple horizontal slave servers ahead of the master slave. 
    - these slave servers can be read only which cache data from master to serve the clients. 
    - also think about geographic scalability - based on IP address if you figure out where the client request is coming, then redirect it to the appropriate slave server. 

reliability: 
    - maintain multiple masters which can be used for failover so if m1, fails then transfer control to m2. 
    - software like zookeeper etc can be used to do this kind of detection etc. 
    
caching: 
    - a hot cache can contain the top new URLs which are trending and cache them.
